## THE LORE
<strong>Welcome to the reality of Taylor Swift's life!!</strong> (kinda ™ :v)

Taylor Lost 6 albums to Scooter Braun when BMR sold them from under her. Help her get them back, avoid all the Scooters and get another grammy (12 aren't enough)!!

## DISCLAIMER
At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written in accordance with the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school:

	- No for, do while, switch, case or goto are allowed
	- No more than 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file
	- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
	- No more than 5 variables in 1 function
 	- All the characters animations were done by me, frame by frame, using Photopea online.
  	- I may have taken a little longer than I needed on the animation part, but it was really fun. If you are short on time for the blackhole absorption, it would not be advisable to do the same.
